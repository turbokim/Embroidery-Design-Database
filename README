This project was a team effort as required in a Database Systems Design class at UWT. The reason for this project was solely to practice SQL and database design. This program is functional as is but not intended to be useful. I do plan on making modifications where I will be able to use this system for my own inventory of embroidery Designs. The shopping cart function was only an added feature me and my team-mates used for demonstration purposes.
